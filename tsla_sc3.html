                <h1>Tesla's Annual Statistics Over the Years</h1>
                <h5>Annual Revenue, Annual Net Income, Annual Gross Profit</h5>
                <p>
                    Let's first take a look at the Annual Revenue by Year.
                </p>
                <h2>TSLA Annual Revenue by Year</h2>
                <div id="scene3" style = "text-align: center;">
                    <div id="graph3"></div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>Hover over the bars to activate the interaction, they will activate and show the revenue for that year</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Tesla was doing well, bringing in a 117 Million USD in revenue the year 2010. It steadily rose to about a 25 Billion dollar company
                    in 2019, and then expontentially shifted to an 80 billion dollar company in 2022. Now, revenue is a great indicator of a company and
                    its products validity, but not of how well the company is actually doing.

                <h2>TSLA Annual Net Income by Year</h2>
                <div id="scene4" style = "text-align: center;">
                    <div id="graph4"></div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>Hover over the bars to activate the interaction, they will activate and show the net income for that year</h5>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>TSLA Annual Gross Profit by Year</h2>
                <div id="scene5" style = "text-align: center;">
                    <div id="graph5"></div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>Hover over the bars to activate the interaction, they will activate and show the gross profit for that year</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If we take a look above, we can see the Annual Net Income and Gross Profit by year for Tesla. The net income
                    is the gross profit without the costs associated with production. As we can see, up until 2019, Tesla was not bringing
                    in money. It is truly amazing that they were able to rise to such a high level even though they were not turning a net
                    positive for so many years.
