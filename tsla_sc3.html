                    If we take a look above, we can see the Annual Revenue and Gross Profit by year for Tesla. The net income
                    is the gross profit without the costs associated with production. As we can see, up until 2019, Tesla was not bringing
                    in money a very large profit. It is truly amazing that they were able to rise to such a high level even though they were not turning a net
                    positive for so many years.
