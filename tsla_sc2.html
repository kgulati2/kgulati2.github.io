                <h1>Tesla Earnings Per Share (EPS)</h1>
                <p>
                    To get an idea of the success and health of Tesla's stocks, specifically in the early 2020s, we can use
                    a known figure called the P/E Ratio. The P/E Ratio can tell us the growth likelihood of a stock depending on its value.
                    Before that, lets first graph the Earnings Per Share (EPS) to get a better idea of Tesla's change from the 10s to the 20s.
                </p>
                <h2>TSLA Annual Earnings Per Share (EPS) & P/E Ratio</h2>
                <div id="scene2">
                    <div id="graph2"></div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h5>Hover over the bars to activate the interaction, they will activate and show the earnings per share for that year</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We can see that for all of the 10s, tesla did not earn a single dollar from its shares. Sure it was doing amazing work, but there
                    simply wasn't a large enough market to really build on the concept & move to a high production status. Because of the Model S's
                    popularity and Tesla's key choices to build vehicles that a larger consumer base could afford, Tesla started to turn a profit.
                    Between 2021 and 2022 they more than doubled their EPS.

                    If we take a look at the table above, we can see the calculated P/E Ratio based on our graphed EPS and average Price Per Share for each year.
                    The ratios are extremely high, with the average technology company having a P/E ratio of around 30. This signifies its high potential of growth
                    as the larger the P/E the more likelihood of growth.

                    Now, lets take a look at some of the annual numbers at a high level.
